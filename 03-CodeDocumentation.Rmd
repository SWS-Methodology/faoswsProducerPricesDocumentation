# **Code and additional material references**

The code of both the shiny application and of the plugin are available both in the SWS and in the project GitHub repository.
The code is commented to make articulated passages clearer. 

The GitHub repository https://github.com/SWS-Methodology/faoswsProducerPrices contains all the code and the additional material that has been used to implement the Producer Prices domain into the SWS.

The Admin console of the SWS provides access to all the plugin codes as well https://sws.fao.org/admin/ui/plugin/all.
